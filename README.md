# HASS-Machinebox-Facebox
Home-Assistant component for facial recognition with one-shot teaching using Machinebox.io https://machineboxio.com/docs/facebox/teaching-facebox


Overall plan for this component: I aim to tackle the problem of presence detection/authentification in Home-assistant. I will use facial recognition/classification to determine when a user is identified, and this will allow them to disarm their alarm system (see https://www.hackster.io/colinodell/diy-alarm-control-panel-for-home-assistant-ac1813). I will show how facial recognition alone is not secure, then add bluetooth presence detection and/or other presence detection and use stats to show the improvement in security.
